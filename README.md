# 2D-Platformer
 A small 3 level 2D Platformer created in Godot with GDScript. 
 Each script was hand written and was my first attempt at a minimally tutorial based project.

 The files included are a mix of spritesheets and photos, as well as scripts and scenes.
 The organization is, without a doubt, a bit of a mess. Keeping my folder neat will be a priority during development of my next game.

The game is available to play on my hosted site https://jackkham.github.io/Website/
Otherwise, feel free to download the file from here.
